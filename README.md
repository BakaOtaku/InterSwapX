### What it does

- Aggregates liquidity across dexes on all chains to grab the best pools
- Uses IBC to swap tokens crosschain via interchain messaging and Osmosis' crosschain calls
- Set up a relayer in between testnets of Osmosis , Injective and Neutron

### Inspiration

- Users need to continuously bridge to separate chains to grab their assets.
- Current aggregators present in Cosmos only aggregate assets on a single chain
- Due to this the best price the user can get on that chain is limited to the liquidity of that asset on that chain
- Or worse, if that asset is not on chain then user can't exchange that asset

### Tech Stack

- Cosmwasm
- Relayer in Hermes
- Injective, Neutron and Osmosis
- Rust and TS

### Future Scope

- Improving the SDK for better routes and prices
- Introduce multihops for multiple chains using ICS-999
